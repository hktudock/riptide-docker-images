# What is sphinx?

Sphinx is a tool for building documentations. More information can be found on the [http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/](Sphinx homepage).

This image includes the latest version of 
- sphinx
- sphinx-autobuild
- sphinx_rtd_theme

# How to use this image.

The default command runs sphinx-autobuild and insalls some requirements
before this.

Default working directory is /src.

This image is meant to be used with [Riptide](https://github.com/theCapypara/riptide-cli). 
Using it without Riptide is probably possible, but not supported.

## Basic Usage with Riptide

See the community repository entry for [https://github.com/theCapypara/riptide-repo/tree/master/app/sphinx/latest.yml](``/app/sphinx/latest``).

This image supports ``run_as_current_user: true`` for services (this is the default).

## Basic Usage with Docker Run

```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
       -v "$(pwd):/src" \
       --user "$(id -u)" \
       riptidepy/sphinx
```

This will start sphinx_autobuild and bind it to the local port 8000.
